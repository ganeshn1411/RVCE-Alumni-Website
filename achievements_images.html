In 1984 when Doordarshan (then the only TV channel in India) began beaming episodes of QUIZ-TIME, the inter-collegiate Quiz competition that was hosted by Siddhartha Basu, RVCE’s unheralded team stunned viewers with their performance. The team was captained by Movin Miranda , Chemical Engineering graduate of the 1987 batch. The 1984 performance was bettered in 1985, with a top four placing in India. Thanks to the exposure, RVCE rightfully came to be recognized far and wide in India as a centre for academic excellence. Movin Miranda has since made a career in Industrial Product Marketing and now serves as Vice-President in a Malaysian firm, exporting hi-tech engineering goods from India to the Oil and Gas market in Malaysia and South-East Asia.
